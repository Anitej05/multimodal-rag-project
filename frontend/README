# Multimodal RAG - Frontend (Plain CSS)

Files: index.html, styles.css, api.js, app.js

## Setup
1. Put these files in your frontend folder (e.g. `D:\multimodal-rag-project\frontend`).
2. Ensure your backend FastAPI server is running (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
3. Serve the frontend folder as static files. E.g.:
   - `npx serve .`
   - or open `index.html` directly in browser.
4. Use "Select files" to choose documents/images/audio, then click "Index Knowledge Base" to call `/ingest`.
5. Ask questions in the Assistant area and click Send. To send audio, attach audio file or record.

## Notes
- This frontend keeps selected files in memory until you index them.
- Reset will call the backend `/reset` which clears the entire knowledge base.
- If your backend runs at a different host/port, edit `API_BASE_URL` in `api.js`.
